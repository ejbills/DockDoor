## AI Assistance Disclosure

> **Policy**: AI-assisted contributions are welcome, but you must understand, test, and take full responsibility for your code. Pasting AI-generated code or PR descriptions without genuine human review and understanding will result in your PR being closed and may result in a ban from contributing.

**Did you use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) for this PR?**
- [ ] No AI tools were used
- [ ] Yes - describe below how AI was used and confirm you reviewed/tested the output

<!-- If yes, briefly describe: What tool? What did it help with? Did you modify/review its output? -->

### What "genuine human review" means:
- You can explain any line of code if asked
- You tested the changes yourself and verified they work
- You understand how your changes interact with existing code
- Your PR description reflects your actual understanding, not AI-generated summaries

### Examples of acceptable AI use:
- "Used Copilot for autocomplete suggestions, reviewed each one"
- "Asked Claude to explain how ScreenCaptureKit works, wrote the implementation myself"
- "Used ChatGPT to help debug an issue, verified the fix myself"

### What will get your PR closed (and possibly banned):
- Pasting AI output directly without review or understanding
- PR descriptions that are clearly AI-generated (overly formal, generic explanations you can't elaborate on)
- Unable to explain your own code changes when asked
- Submitting large refactors with undocumented behavioral changes
