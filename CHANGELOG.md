## üöÄ New Features

- **Efficient Dock Item Detection and Improved Window Management**: [@ShlomoCode](https://github.com/ShlomoCode), [@ejbills](https://github.com/ejbills) 
  - **Dock Item Detection**: The current Dock item is now detected using macOS Dock's native detection (`kAXSelectedChildrenChangedNotification` and `kAXSelectedChildrenAttribute`) instead of relying on mouse position calculations.
  - **Performance Improvement**: Removed the global listener for mouse events, which significantly reduces CPU usage to 0% when not interacting or hovering with the Dock.
  - **Window Cache Management**: Windows are now cached by PID instead of BundleID, improving compatibility with apps like scrcpy that do not have a BundleID.
  - **Window State Management**: Enhanced logic for managing window states, including addressing window switcher update inconsistencies.
  - **Window Fade Out Animations**: Introduced window fade-out animations and added configuration options for customization.
