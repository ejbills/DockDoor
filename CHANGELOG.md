<a id="v1.18.3"></a>
# [v1.18.3](https://github.com/ejbills/DockDoor/releases/tag/v1.18.3) - 2025-07-18

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Window Switcher MRU Ordering
* **Fixed critical window switcher bug**: Resolved issue where Window Switcher would incorrectly switch to unused windows of the same app instead of maintaining proper Most Recently Used (MRU) ordering
* **Improved window timestamp management**: Implemented a single point of entry for updating window timestamps, ensuring reliable and consistent MRU tracking
* **Enhanced cross-application switching**: Window Switcher now properly alternates between different applications without unexpectedly jumping to inactive windows of the same app

[Changes][v1.18.3]


<a id="v1.18.2"></a>
# [v1.18.2](https://github.com/ejbills/DockDoor/releases/tag/v1.18.2) - 2025-07-11

- Fixed issue where window timestamps weren't updating when clicking on dock icons or directly clicking on windows. The app now properly detects these interactions and updates only the specific window that was clicked, ensuring accurate MRU (Most Recently Used) ordering in the window switcher.

---
  Note: This addresses a remaining issue from the previous window ordering fix that was missed in the earlier release.

<a id="v1.14.4"></a>
# [v1.14.4](https://github.com/ejbills/DockDoor/releases/tag/v1.14.4) - 2025-06-13

## Fixed Apple Music Support
- **Fixed**: Apple Music artwork now properly converts binary data to base64 data URLs
- **Improved**: Error handling for artwork retrieval failures

[Changes][v1.14.4]


<a id="v1.14.3"></a>
# [v1.14.3](https://github.com/ejbills/DockDoor/releases/tag/v1.14.3) - 2025-06-13

## üêõ Bug Fixes
-   Refined the display logic for special app controls (e.g., Music, Spotify, Calendar):
    -   When "Show media/calendar controls on Dock hover" (`showSpecialAppControls`) is enabled:
        -   If "Embed controls with window previews" (`useEmbeddedMediaControls`) is also enabled:
            -   Special controls will be embedded within the preview area alongside actual window previews if any are visible.
            -   If no window previews are visible (e.g., app has no open windows or all are minimized), the special controls will be shown in a larger, standalone embedded format.
        -   If "Embed controls with window previews" is disabled:
            -   The special controls will be shown in a larger, standalone format, replacing any window previews for that app.
    -   When "Show media/calendar controls on Dock hover" is disabled:
        -   Standard window previews will be shown for all apps, including those that have special controls available.
-   Updated the "Interaction & Behavior (Dock Previews)" section in Main Settings to include a new toggle for "Embed controls with window previews", which is active when "Show media/calendar controls on Dock hover" is enabled. This provides users with finer control over how these special app integrations are displayed.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Window Preview Issues
- **Fixed lateral movement behavior** where window previews would incorrectly persist when moving between dock items
- **Resolved issue** where apps with zero open windows would incorrectly display previews from previously hovered apps
- **Improved preview state management** to ensure consistent behavior when hovering over closed applications
- **Fixed race condition** in preview processing that could cause stale previews to remain visible

### Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced task cancellation** by properly resetting `isProcessing` flag when cancelling existing preview tasks
- **Improved preview reliability** by fixing defer block execution in cancelled operations
- **Better state management** prevents new preview requests from being blocked by stale state from previous operations

## üìù Notes

- Music controls feature supports **Apple Music and Spotify only** due to Apple's restrictions on the MRMediaRemote private API (locked down in macOS 15.4)

<a id="v1.13.1"></a>
# [v1.13.1](https://github.com/ejbills/DockDoor/releases/tag/v1.13.1) - 2025-06-04

### üõ† Improvements & Fixes

‚ö†Ô∏è This update changes a large amount of code. Be sure to report bugs if encountered.

### üÜï What's New in DockDoor

* **Arrow Key Navigation**
  Navigate through windows in both the Window Switcher and Dock Previews using arrow keys and Tab, then press Return to select your desired window‚Äîperfect for keyboard-driven workflows.

* **Enhanced Keyboard Shortcuts**
  Added essential keyboard shortcuts to selected windows in previews: use Tab or arrow keys to select a window, then press `CMD + W` to close, `CMD + Q` to quit the app, or `CMD + M` to minimize‚Äîall without touching your mouse.

* **Improved Window State Management**
  Completely redesigned the underlying window tracking system using observed objects for better memory efficiency and more reliable window state synchronization across all views.

---

### üõ† Improvements & Fixes

* **Performance Optimizations**
  - Refactored memory management by removing redundant window states
  - Implemented queued window switcher for smoother operation
  - Enhanced flow algorithm for better responsiveness

* **Window Tracking Reliability**
  - Fixed issue where closed windows would still appear in the Window Switcher
  - Improved window filter validation to ensure only active windows are displayed
  - Better activation attempt handling for more consistent behavior

* **Architecture Improvements**
  - Streamlined window state orchestration between dock previews and child window views
  - Reduced memory bloat by eliminating duplicate window object copies
  - Enhanced cross-view communication for better action synchronization

### üÜï What's New in DockDoor

* **Keep Window Switcher Open**
  New option to keep the window switcher visible after releasing the shortcut key‚Äîgreat for slower switching or multitasking.

  ![Window Switcher](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc40025-b273-4bef-b7ac-3672b0bec156)

* **Settings Pane in Window Switcher**
  You can now access DockDoor settings directly from the window switcher.

* **Update Notification in Dock Previews**
  When a new DockDoor version is available, a handy **"Update available"** button will appear in Dock Previews.

* **"New Window" Button**
  Adds a new button that attempts to trigger `CMD + N` in the selected app. In some apps (like Finder), this opens a new window. In others, it might do something else‚Äîdepends on the app.
