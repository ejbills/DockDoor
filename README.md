## Usage

- **How to use the Alt-Tab feature?**
  - To switch between windows, hold down the `Command` key (<strong>&#8984;</strong>) and press the `Tab` key (<strong>&RightArrowBar;</strong>) repeatedly until the desired window is highlighted. To go back, press `Shift` in addition to `Tab`. Release both keys to switch to the selected window.
  - Disabling the default `Cmd + Tab` keybind will allow the user to set a custom keybind.
      - User chooses one of the modifier keys presented on the screen (`Command`, `Option` or `Control`);
      - User clicks on `Start Recording Keybind`;
      - User presses the key they want to associate with the previously selected modifier key;
      - Keybind is now set!
