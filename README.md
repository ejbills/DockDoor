## Usage

- **How do I use the alt-tab functionality?**
  - By default, use Cmd + Tab to open the window switcher, continue pressing Tab to increment forwards, Shift + Tab to go back. Letting go of command will select the window.
  - Disabling the default Cmd + Tab keybind, will allow a user to set a custom keybind
      - User selects one of the modifiers presented on the screen
      - User presses `Record Keybind` button
      - User presses a singular key on the keyboard
      - Keybind is now set!

### FAQ

- I disabled the menu bar icon and now I can't access settings
  - When DockDoor initially opens, the menu icon will be visible for 10 seconds, until it disappears. This way, you can access the settings even with the icon disabled. Just relaunch the app and click it before it disappears.
- I click on the purple quit button in the preview and the app doesn't close
  - You can hold the Option (âŒ¥) key while clicking to force quit.
