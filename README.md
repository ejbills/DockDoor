## Frequently Asked Questions

If this option is enabled, click on the *door* icon in the menu bar and select `Open Settings` in the contextual menu.

### The application I want to quit does not respond.

### Translating

Open the following link to contribute by translating DockDoor. You will need to create a Crowdin account, but you can link it to your GitHub account.

### Translating the website (https://dockdoor.net)

To enhance web communication, we invite you to help translate the project’s website, https://dockdoor.net, with the following link: https://crowdin.com/project/dockdoor-website.

**But before you begin translating**, please consider the following points:
- The strings contain **basic HTML tags**. It is recommended to have **some familiarity with HTML**. You can find many tutorials online, and HTML is particularly easy to learn.
- As a consequence, please **respect the markup** indicated in the source language. For a word surrounded by `<strong>` tags, add `<strong>` (and `</strong>` to close it) around the equivalent word in your language.
- A few strings contain special codes such as `&#8984;` or `&RightArrowBar;`. If you hover over them on Crowdin in the source language, you can see what character it represents. **The semicolon here is crucial. Do not omit it.**
- Other strings contain `&nbsp;` between words. **These are no-break spaces. They are not substitutable with regular spaces.** Use them as much as needed in the source language.
> [!TIP]
> Click on the tags to paste them directly into your translation. The same process also works for special codes.

- There are a few `<span>` tags (e.g., `<span class='yellow-highlight'>` `</span>`). Copy them **exactly** as they appear in the source language.
- **Escape your quotation marks** using `\` before them! If you don’t, translations might fail to render.
