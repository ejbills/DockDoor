**Help**
- I disabled the menu bar icon and now I can't access settings
  - When DockDoor initially opens, the menu icon will be visible for 10 seconds, until it disappears. This way, you can access the settings even with the icon disabled. Just relaunch the app and click it before it disappears.
- I click on the purple quit button in the preview and the app doesn't close
  - You can hold the Option (âŒ¥) key while clicking to force quit.
